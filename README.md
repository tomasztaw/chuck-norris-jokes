## Project Description

This project is a simple web application that allows users to browse Chuck Norris jokes. Users can choose between displaying a random joke or selecting a specific category.
The application connects "underneath" to [chucknorris.io](https://api.chucknorris.io/) and displays the joke.
Then another API SpeechSynthesisUtterance gives us the ability to read it by machine.

## Technologies Used

- Java Spring
- Thymeleaf
- JavaScript

## Installation

The application is hosted online, and no local installation is required.

## Running the App

Visit [Chuck Norris Jokes App](https://chuck-norris-jokes-sc09.onrender.com) to access the application.

## Usage

1. On the main page, choose between "Random Joke" or "Select Category."
2. If you choose "Random Joke," click the button to display a joke.
3. If you choose "Select Category," choose a category and click the button to display a joke from that category.
